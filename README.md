# Reach Tech Intern Interview: Make a (simple) CMS 

A CMS or Content Management System is an interface for writers to enter, view, edit and publish content / information. Today we will be working to build a simple CMS in the language of your choice. 

Our CMS will store articles with the following properties: 

Mandatory: 
- Article Title (text)
- Article Body, with a word limit of 500 characters (text)
- Article Authour (text) 

Optional: 
- Lead Image for Article (URL in the correct format - standard URL format is: protocol://domainOrIPAddress:port/path/filename)

Example image URLs: 
- http://quotesnhumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Top-30-Funny-Cat-Memes-Hilarious.jpg
- http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/dexterdidi_9061.png

## Instructions 

1. Write a script that allows writers to input the mandatory properties for an article, and store this input in a data structure 
  - _Bonus_: How would you amend your script to allow viewing or editing of the content?
2. Add to your script functionality for adding the optional property of a lead image via supplying an image URL 
  - _Bonus_: How would you store this image alongside the other content?
